Folder org contains obligatory part 1 and 2.

To run server command:
python server.py -p[Port] -l[Adress]


To run client command:
python client.py 



Folder bonus contains optional part 3.

To run server command:
python server.py


To run client command:
python client.py


Comment: Bonus part still has some bugs to be fixed. RPC and broadcasting channel did not work because of threading problem. Hovewer, we have implemented interface on indirect communication.
